# Overview

A collection of tools used investigating primes among Gaussian integers.

My goal with this code was really to work on coding more neatly. It's mostly formatted in PEP8, and it has docstrings for most functions/methods.
I recently got some nice plugins running with Emacs (elpy and autopep8), which has been very nice.
